🧸💬 In this scenario, the communication device and communication channel have ```primary objective influent``` because device authorization convenience users by removing or reducing the number of steps for ```verification method``` with ```fully authorized services``` provided by the ```application in development``` and continuing development. Some external variables we cannot control such as ```rush hour actions``` we had discussed before about ```applications used in public``` and external cannot control variables that affect users by ```rush hour``` method can be studied and investigated by user ```control design ( UI/UX design )``` 🥺💬 🐑💬 ➰ They removed the application features and the case is in court . </br>

👤💬 I remember the case of UI practical in public number of steps to goal is the same but identify intention action designed by UX/UI design. For example, bright colours ```contrast light``` or slide bars control.  👧💬 🎈 In the case of ```Numpad```, ```an extensible``` and ```design label monitor``` we would like to have a ```sidebar``` too which is an ```instant counterpart``` when we need it. </br>
🦭💬 Someone's initial requirements are that switching slide bar or ```transmission slidebar``` is a good idea or an extensible monitor but finally sidebar and ```customizable functions``` are the proper way by conclusion 👧💬 🎈 ```Extensible``` can perform of their ```function seamlessly``` when it is ```attached and transfers``` the menu, and ```extensions authorized menu``` and in any case, ```sidebar user control is working``` .  👧💬 🎈 📺💬 </br>

🐑💬 ➰ In this scenario, users had ```multiple devices supported by multiple-platform``` running in the same authorized user in IT software solution, external may try to ```manipulate their actions by rush hours technique``` when they are busy all day with meetings and try to complete their work within the day and he ```accidentally approved a request from a different requester``` for only simple authorization action such as an ```request a new folder for email inbox``` or ```email account``` . </br>

🧸💬 In this scenario, the communication device and communication channel have ```primary objective influent``` because device authorization convenience users by removing or reducing the number of steps for ```verification method``` with ```fully authorized services``` provided by the ```application in development``` and continuing development. Some external variables we cannot control such as ```rush hour actions``` we had discussed before about ```applications used in public``` and external cannot control variables that affect users by ```rush hour``` method can be studied and investigated by user ```control design ( UI/UX design )``` 🥺💬 🐑💬 ➰ They removed the application features and the case is in court . </br>

👤💬 I remember the case of UI practical in public number of steps to goal is the same but identify intention action designed by UX/UI design. For example, bright colours ```contrast light``` or slide bars control.  👧💬 🎈 In the case of ```Numpad```, ```an extensible``` and ```design label monitor``` we would like to have a ```sidebar``` too which is an ```instant counterpart``` when we need it. </br>
🦭💬 Someone's initial requirements are that switching slide bar or ```transmission slidebar``` is a good idea or an extensible monitor but finally sidebar and ```customizable functions``` are the proper way by conclusion 👧💬 🎈 ```Extensible``` can perform of their ```function seamlessly``` when it is ```attached and transfers``` the menu, and ```extensions authorized menu``` and in any case, ```sidebar user control is working``` .  👧💬 🎈 📺💬 </br>

## 🧸💬 Sample case results from rush hours actions

(1) 🐑💬 ➰ In this scenario, users had ```multiple devices supported by multiple-platform``` running in the same authorized user in IT software solution, external may try to ```manipulate their actions by rush hours technique``` when they are busy all day with meetings and try to complete their work within the day and he ```accidentally approved a request from a different requester``` for only simple authorization action such as an ```request a new folder for email inbox``` or ```email account``` . </br>
🐐💬 Of course new account for an email has been created with default authorization without monitoring because approved by high-level management but it cannot run or work in any process without ```required permissions granted``` and they may not have ```time expired``` or a member of a ```high authorized workgroup```. For year later administrative prevention found a test user's email account and tried to find an authorized person who ```granted the permission``` when reading the ```activity logs``` they found this account did not perform anything except ```monitor for the same workgroup inbox``` for incoming emails. </br>
💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 For a year or more the ```vice president``` of the company found later, someone ```intercepted of notification email from the system and replaced it with advertising emails``` that made high-level members in the same group ```blocked``` or ```created auto-rules to handle the message```. One day an important came from the business team he did not have the email or was not included in the email loop even after all years of working with ```good relationships with team members``` and his ```performance dropped the first time``` and ```continued``` from this email behavior when he ```had experience``` enough to have a ```conversation with IT solution and IT support team``` for email behavior but the answer is hard for a conclusion because once reset the permission and right it revert back in a week or day because it is auto-setting rules in team members email clients. ( ```🐑💬 ➰ This is a real case and it is accumulation pains because of indecent time and it happens by correct understanding of both sides``` ) </br> 

(2) 🦭💬 In the same scenarios ```second case``` is the same action for auto-settings rules and user permission actions but this time file size transmission is filtered out and starts a new action reply of a large number of design documents file word that is caused by ```a macro``` or ```file format missing with validation method```. Start from working project team started using external links and the ```security policy was compromised```, the ```experienced IT admin``` came in and spoke in the meeting room about the issue by providing an ```external verified link``` for sending files in case of ```file sizes policy``` and confirming with the IT department there is no file sizes limited policy ```to stop of new action become a behavior```. 🐑💬 ➰ Unfortunately someone hit external links and started to initiate the virus into the system again thank you Trend Maro </br>

(3) 🦁💬 One more example, we could not use ```email ID``` when they are using ```Lotus Note client``` or ```Domino client```. The IT admin tries to request a new note file and initiate of new note client with a password and authorized parameters but they cannot open and read the email or ```only one time can read the email and reset once the domino client closes```. 🐑💬 ➰ I will tell you again when you return temporary email ID </br>

(4) 🥺💬 By accident, the HDD of my computer is broken, and the ```working schedule is busy``` and the computer is required for work. ```OS platform compatibility``` and device control signal development are protected by the ```platform access level``` because it is required by different platforms and working with ```FAT32 files``` is in different format file reading. ```T-driver``` can communicate with both ```MACOS``` file system and ```FAT32``` file system and the ```encryption application``` known of their workspace since initial running and during run time expandable ability but it does not include different platforms' device control and it will not override the behavior. 🥺💬  I think I returned it correct format and I example because that is by someone's intention and I informed my action ```IT expert``` the same way I informed ```Facebook``` about the ```session ID``` case <== It is correct behavior, 📻💦💦 🥺💬 I am hearing he talking about my action every day and I think he should stop but he continues doing it until today. Do I cheat? </br>

🐐💬 I do not know the police, these actions are only a few examples of how they create sales but we are not proved of it and what are they doing to our friends too. Leave him to go back to work. </br>

🧸💬 A pizza and cookie are from the same company's owner, maybe he tried to respond to their questions when they continued communication with the speaker lounds, and he response about his performance only and he absolutely informed it. 🍕🍪🍪 </br>
🐯💬 We remembered how the company invented they are working by drafts working hard as drafts and listening to you as drafts, never be tried and never be stopped. Clumpsy! 👨‍💻🧑‍💻👩‍💻 </br>

## 🧸💬 Sample case known authorized and acquiring

🐑💬 ➰ The ```ransomware``` does not happen today but it comes back with overall awareness ignored the ```standard security application level```, the ```ABC games 🅰️🅱️``` once came with ```ransomware``` and also the ```crossword games``` because people action by their assumption than prove of evidence and it is the same happened when ```randsomeware``` repeating of the same behavior. 🧩🃏 </br>
🦭💬 At the time we communicate to people and technology users communication is used in the comfortable and efficient way, the encrypted messages and high standard prizes of word conversation create luxury of word paragraphs and leverage levels but the primary purpose of communication is fast, conscripts, effective, repeats and revise and applicable to apply. </br>
